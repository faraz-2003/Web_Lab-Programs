    <section id="rules">
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape. There are also several other ways to end a game, such as stalemate, agreement between the players, the fifty-move rule, or a draw by insufficient material.</p>

While evaluating a position, players consider the value of pieces on the board, pawn structure, king safety, and control of key squares and groups of squares (e.g., diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).</p>
